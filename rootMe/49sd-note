Hey,

Please create a zip of the files you want to commit, and place em in the repos directory located at /home/49sd/repos

I'll commit them eventally, if you want to commit em ASAP, I have given you access, so you can run the script file I use to commit the files with out a password.

Peace Out,
r00T
