# Why?
Light level-of-effort RE challenge. No actual decompilers needed, just adding input to the code
to see what the program does

# What?
This program just takes the user input and XORs it against the flag. 

# How solve?
Add input and see the difference in your input versus the output.
Given the difference of the output versus input, you can tell the value of the flag.
The flag for this challenge has been shortened from the typical size since solving
only a few characters indicates the challenge is understood and going further is not
needed.

# Flag
flag{TN04MBy52B}
