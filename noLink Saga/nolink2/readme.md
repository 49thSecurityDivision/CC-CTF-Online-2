## nolink 2: return of the links
by gen3, easyish (2/5)

## goal 
write a script that will auto click/follow the links, this script must maintain an internal state to 
keep the player from getting into loops. it must also check for 404's since there are dead ends.

## prompt
one step forward, one step backward, one step nowhere http://nolink.whatever:8080/

## solution
I'm not gonna write the code rn but you just take the old code and add the stuff in the goal
